# Developer Readme

Information about development matters related to Graphite.

## Build system

To build the project, first run `./configure`.  There are some configuration options available, see `./configure --help`, and by default all possible platforms are built.  Then, run `make build` to compile the project.

## Template system

We use Jinja2 as a templating system to handle elements that need to be repeated in multiple files, such as configuration defaults, messaging keys or the version number.  Then, files like `package.json` are build from a template (`package.template.json`).  For most files, we use a custom inline template syntax, though, which is directly inside the source files.  For instance, you might find something like this:

    // -- autogen
    // -- #define GRAPHITE_N_CONFIG {{ num_config_items }}
    #define GRAPHITE_N_CONFIG 10
    // -- end autogen

This is a section that gets automatically generated.  All lines starting with `// --` after the `autogen` line are the template, which can refer to template variables such as `num_config_items`.  Then following lines are then the instantiation of that template, automatically generated by the templating system.  To update the section if the template variables change, run `make initialize`.  All template variables are defined in `scripts/initialize.py`.


## Releasing a New Version

To release a new version, do the following:

- Make changes to Graphite.
- Document changes in `README.md` in the changelog.
- Update version number in `scripts/initialize.py`.
- Update table in `README.md` that relates app version numbers with configuration version numbers.
    - Publish a new branch `config-X` if a new configuration version `X` was necessary.
- Build a clean version: `make clean build`.
- Upload and publish new version.
